hello.comment=Hi @%s! I can help you index your Github-hosted website, provided that the repository name respects \
              the format ``owner.github.io`` (or has a ``gh-pages`` branch) and the command is given by the repo's owner.\n\n\
              More on commands [here](http://charles.amihaiemil.com/doc.html#commands).
index.start.comment=@%s thank you for the command, the indexing process started just now. I will let you know of the outcome \
               shortly. In the meantime, you can check the logs [here](%s).

unknown.comment=@%s sorry I do not understand you. See [this link](http://charles.amihaiemil.com/doc.html#commands) for more details.
denied.commander.comment=@%s only the repository's owner can trigger an index action.\n\nIf the repository is under an organization \
                         you must be an active admin and **I must be a member** (this is because currently I cannot check your membership \
                         otherwise - see [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/members/#get-organization-membership)).

denied.fork.comment=@%s the repository must not be a fork, you must own this repository.

denied.name.comment=@%s the repository's name must match the format ``owner.github.io`` or it must have a project website on branch ``gh-pages``


denied.badlink.comment=@%s the given page does not seem to belong to the website hosted in this repo!\n\n\
                    Make sure that the link starts with ``http://`` or ``https://`` followed by\
                     ``yourusername.github.io/...`` Do not use the CNAME or any other link, even if it redirects to\
                     a page from this repo. \n\n \ If this condition is met and it still doesn't work please open an issue [here]\
                    (https://github.com/amihaiemil/charles-github-ejb/issues).

step.failure.comment=@%s Some steps failed when precessing your command. See [logs](%s) for details.

index.finished.comment=@%s Index command executed successfully! \n \
                         Add the following script to the website in order to make the search functionality available:\n\n \
                         &lt;script src=&quot;#&quot;&gt;%s&lt;/script&gt; \n\n \
                         See [logs](%s) for more details. \n \
                         If you notice any inexplicable errors, please open an issue \
                         <a href="https://github.com/amihaiemil/charles-github-ejb">here</a>
