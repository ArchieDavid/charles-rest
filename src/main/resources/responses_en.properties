hello.comment=Hi @%s! I can help you index your Github-hosted website, provided that the repository name respects \
              the format ``owner.github.io`` (or has a ``gh-pages`` branch) and the command is given by the repo's owner.\n\n\
              More on commands [here](http://charles.amihaiemil.com/doc.html#commands).
index.start.comment=@%s thank you for the command, the indexing process started just now. I will let you know of the outcome \
               shortly. In the meantime, you can check the logs [here](%s).

unknown.comment=@%s sorry I do not understand you. See [this link](http://charles.amihaiemil.com/doc.html#commands) for more details.
denied.commander.comment=@%s only the repository's owner can trigger such an action.\n\nIf the repository is under an organization \
                         you must be an active admin and **I must be a member** (this is because currently I cannot check your membership \
                         otherwise - see [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/members/#get-organization-membership)).

denied.fork.comment=@%s the repository must not be a fork, you must own this repository.

denied.name.comment=@%s the repository's name must match the format ``owner.github.io`` or it must have a project website on branch ``gh-pages``


denied.badlink.comment=@%s the given page does not seem to belong to the website hosted in this repo!\n\n\
                    Make sure that the link starts with ``http://`` or ``https://`` followed by\
                     ``yourusername.github.io/...`` Do not use the CNAME or any other link, even if it redirects to\
                     a page from this repo. \n\n \ If this condition is met and it still doesn't work please open an issue [here]\
                    (https://github.com/opencharles/charles-rest/issues/new).

denied.deleteindex.comment=@%s the repository's name in a delete command has to be between single back apostrophes.\n\
                           and it has to match the actual reponame exactly (case sensitive) \n\n\
                           A valid delete command here is ``@%s delete `%s` index``.

index.missing.comment=@%s there is no index for this repo, so your command \
                      cannot be fulfilled. Either the index was removed already \
                      following a ``delete`` command, or it has never existed.\n\n\
                      Check the [logs](%s) for more details.

step.failure.comment=@%s Some steps failed when processing your command. See [logs](%s) for details.\n\
                         Try again and if the error persists please, open an [issue](https://github.com/opencharles/charles-rest/issues/new).

index.finished.comment=@%s Index command executed successfully! \n \
                         Add the following [script](https://github.com/opencharles/charles-search-box#reactjs-search-box-component) \
                         to the website in order to make the search functionality available:\n\n \
                         &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; id=&quot;charlesscript&quot; repo=&quot;%s&quot;\
                         src=&quot;http://amihaiemil.github.io/js/charles.min.js&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt; \n\n \
                         See [logs](%s) for more details. \n \
                         If you notice any inexplicable errors, please open an issue \
                         [here](https://github.com/opencharles/charles-rest/issues/new)

deleteindex.finished.comment=@%s the `%s` index was successfully deleted. \n\
                              Don't forget to remove the script form your website since the search will not work anymore.\n\
                              See [logs](%s) for details.\n\n\
                              If you can spare a minute, please consider opening an issue [here](https://github.com/opencharles/charles-rest/issues/new),\
                              let us know why you stopped using this service, what you didn't like and what we could improve. Thanks!
