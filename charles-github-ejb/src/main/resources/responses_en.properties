hello.comment=Hi, @%s! I can help you index your Github-hosted website, provided that the repository name respects \
              the format ``owner.github.io`` (or has a ``gh-pages`` branch) and the command is given by the repo's owner. 
index.comment=@%s, thank you for the command, the indexing process started just now. I will let you know of the outcome \
               shortly.
#TODO add the link to the commands' docs
unknown.comment=@%s, sorry, I do not understand you. See [this link](#) for more details.
denied.commander.comment=@%s, only the repository's owner can trigger an index action
denied.fork.comment=@%s, the repository must not be a fork, you must own this repository.
denied.name.comment=@%s, the repository's name must match the format ``owner.github.io`` or it must have a project website on branch ``gh-pages``
